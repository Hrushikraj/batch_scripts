# Implementing anti-debugging techniques in BAT scripts. 
Anti-debugging techniques in BAT scripts are limited compared to more advanced programming languages. However, we can still use some methods to detect whether the script is being executed in a debug or analysis environment.
## Explanation of the Techniques
1. Method 1: Checking for Debugging Tools
   * Uses tasklist to search for running processes associated with debugging tools (e.g., Windbg, OllyDbg, Process Explorer).
   * Exits the script if any of these tools are found.
2. Method 2: Timing Anomalies
   * Compares the script's execution time for specific operations.
   * Debuggers often slow down execution, so a delay mismatch can indicate debugging.
3. Method 4: Invalid Operations
   * Executes an invalid operation (e.g., divide by zero).
   * Debuggers may cause this operation to behave differently, allowing detection.

## :loudspeaker:Limitations
  * Reliability: These techniques are basic and can be bypassed by skilled analysts.
  * BAT Script Capabilities: Batch files are limited compared to languages like C or Python in terms of implementing advanced anti-debugging techniques.
  * Performance: Timing checks can be inconsistent on different systems.
