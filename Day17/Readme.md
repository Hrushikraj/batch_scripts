### Evading Detection by Hiding Script Operations

This Batch script demonstrates techniques to perform operations in the background, minimizing visibility and reducing the likelihood of detection.

#### Key Features:
1. **Redirect Outputs**:
   - Suppress standard output and error messages to prevent visual cues.
2. **Background Execution**:
   - Use `start /b` to run commands without a visible window.
3. **File Hiding**:
   - Modify file attributes to make them hidden and system-protected.
4. **Minimized Processes**:
   - Run processes in a minimized state using `start /min`.

#### Example Use Cases:
- Running background maintenance tasks.
- Silently modifying configurations or files.
- Logging actions discreetly.

**Disclaimer**: These techniques should be used responsibly for legitimate purposes only.
