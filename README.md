# 100-Day BAT Scripting Challenge (Malware Development & Analysis)

### Week 1: Basic BAT Scripting for Malware Behavior
- **Day 1**: Learn basic echo commands and comments, but with a twist of creating a decoy message script.
- **Day 2**: Variables and environmental manipulation in BAT scripts, such as changing paths or user settings.
- **Day 3**: Basic file operationsâ€”creating, deleting, or hiding files to simulate malicious behavior.
- **Day 4**: Using `if` statements to simulate malware conditions (e.g., if file exists, execute a payload).
- **Day 5**: File obfuscation techniques like renaming critical files.
- **Day 6**: Basic automation to simulate system changes (e.g., disabling system tools).
- **Day 7**: Dropping and executing files via batch scripts.

### Week 2: Working with Persistence Mechanisms
- **Day 8**: Writing a script to create persistence by adding to the startup folder or registry.
- **Day 9**: Simulating persistence through scheduled tasks.
- **Day 10**: Modify system policies using scripts (e.g., disabling Task Manager).
- **Day 11**: Writing scripts that modify system boot configurations.
- **Day 12**: Using `schtasks` to automate repetitive malicious tasks.
- **Day 13**: Implementing file hiding techniques using BAT scripts.
- **Day 14**: Writing a self-replicating script to mimic worm behavior.

### Week 3: Anti-Analysis and Evasion Techniques
- **Day 15**: Detecting if the script is running in a virtual environment (e.g., VirtualBox).
- **Day 16**: Implementing anti-debugging techniques in BAT scripts.
- **Day 17**: Evading detection by hiding script operations in the background.
- **Day 18**: Bypassing User Account Control (UAC) in Windows.
- **Day 19**: Obfuscating BAT scripts using variable manipulation and encoding.
- **Day 20**: Clearing system logs using BAT scripts.
